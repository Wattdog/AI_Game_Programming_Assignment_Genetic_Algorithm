# AI_Game_Programming_Assignment_Genetic_Algorithm

The program will take a created maze file with a .txt file type (e.g. file_name.txt). You will add this to the project folder and then launch the debugger. From there you can then enter the file name and the Algorithm will then work out the shortest path.

Currently the Algorithm doesn't work it won't be able to reach the set goal due to the amount of time I had left. This project will show comments throughout the code showing what would have been done if I had more time to work on this.
